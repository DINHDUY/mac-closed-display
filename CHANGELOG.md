## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- App icon: `AppIcon` asset catalog with all required macOS sizes (16 → 1024 pt, @1x and @2x)
- 1024 × 1024 px App Store icon (no alpha channel; squircle mask applied by system)

### Changed

### Added
- Menu bar status icon with three states: active (●), suspended (⏸), disabled (○)
